# Scraping-RottenTomatoes
A Jupyter Notebook I did as a Homework in an Udemy WebScraping Course

I also wrote a Python script and it asks for an user input, so I can give URL I want for the RottenTomatoes Website. But for data analysis and for hobby, I prefer the Jupyter version. After getting this course about WebScraping, as an homework, we were supposed to write this script.Later, I also went on improving on this task and doing some analysis for my interest since I'm keen on cinema.

In this repo, you can find the Jupyter notebook file for Web Scraping from Rotten Tomatoes Website. The code works very well and you can try and edit as you wish. I also added some exampel screen shots which are the results of my analysis.

**Example screenshots from my Scraping Rotten Tomatoes Website for Best Horror Movies Analysis:**
